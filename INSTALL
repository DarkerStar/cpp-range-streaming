Installation Instructions

Library installation
====================

   The library does not require installation. It consists of a single
C++ header file - stream_range. To use the library facilities, simply
make sure that the header file can be find in the include search path
(either by placing it with the system includes, or - better - using a
compiler option to add it to the include search path).

Testing
=======

   A minimal test suite for the range streaming facilities is provided.
It is not a full or exhaustive test suite - it is merely intended to
confirm proper behaviour in common situations.

   The test suite requires Google Test <https://code.google.com/p/googletest/>.
A minimal version of Google Test is included in the "test/gtest" folder,
using fused files. (See <https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/AdvancedGuide#Fusing_Google_Test_Source_Files>
for more information.)

   To build the test program, simply run "make" in the "test" folder.
Running "make check" will build the test program (if necessary), then
run it.

   The test program requires C++11 (naturally), so it may be necessary
to provide special command line parameters. The easiest way to do this
is to run the following two commands:
  CXXFLAGS='-std=c++11'
  CXXFLAGS=$CXXFLAGS make check

You can change the first command to use whatever options you wish.
