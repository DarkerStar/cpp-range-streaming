Installation Instructions
*************************

Library installation
====================

   The library does not require installation. It consists of a single
C++ header file - stream_range. To use the library facilities, simply
make sure that the header file can be find in the include search path
(either by placing it with the system includes, or - better - using a
compiler option to add it to the include search path).

Testing
=======

   A minimal test suite for the range streaming facilities is provided.
It is not a full or exhaustive test suite - it is merely intended to
confirm proper behaviour in common situations.

   The test suite requires Google Test <https://code.google.com/p/googletest/>.
A minimal version of Google Test is included in the "test/gtest" folder,
using fused files. (See <https://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/AdvancedGuide#Fusing_Google_Test_Source_Files>
for more information.)

   To build the test program, simply run "make" in the "test" folder.
Running "make check" will build the test program (if necessary), then
run it.

   The test program requires C++11 (naturally), so it may be necessary
to provide special command line options. The easiest way to do this is
to add the required options the environment variable CXXFLAGS:
  export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -std=c++11"
You can add whatever other options you wish, of course.

Once you've done that, "make check" just does the right thing:
  make check


### Testing with Boost ###

   If you have Boost, you can do some extra tests that use Boost.Range.
By default, these tests are not included. If you want to add them, you
must define a variable called HAVE_BOOST. For example:
  make check HAVE_BOOST=1

(Of course, you can also export an environment variable called
HAVE_BOOST - as shown with CXXFLAGS above - if you wish.)
